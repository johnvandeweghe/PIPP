# IPP 1.1 PHP Implementation: PIPP

IPP 1.1 is defined by two RFCs:

- RFC 2910 deals with data models and encoding in the Operations Layer, and is covered by the IPP\Encoding namespace, along with the Operation, Attribute and AttributeGroup classes.

- RFC 2911 discusses the operations and what they actually do, and is currently a WIP.

**NOTE:** RFC 2910 is much smaller, so it will likely take time for 2911 to be implemented.
